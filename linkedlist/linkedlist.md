# üìö LinkedList in Java

## üí° How I Approach Implementing an Operation

Whenever I start building or debugging an operation:
1. I **draw the current state** of the LinkedList ‚Äî showing head, tail, and all the nodes.
2. I **label references clearly** and imagine how they should change after the operation.
3. I focus not on *how* to write the code immediately, but on *what references or logic* are needed.

> This habit of visualizing the structure first helps me understand pointer movements clearly and avoids confusion.

## üîç What is the Underlying Data Structure?

- The underlying data structure of `LinkedList` is a **Doubly Linked List**.
- Nodes are stored **non-contiguously** in memory.
- Each node contains:
    - Data
    - Reference to the **previous** node
    - Reference to the **next** node

---

## üöÄ When Should You Use a LinkedList?

Use `LinkedList` when:

- You need **frequent insertions or deletions** of elements.
- **Random access** is **not** a priority (poor retrieval performance due to linear traversal).
- Elements need to be **added/removed from the beginning, middle, or end** frequently.

Avoid `LinkedList` if:

- Your main operation is **retrieval by index**.
- You need **cache locality** or **fast access** to elements.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Implementation Understanding

To implement a custom LinkedList, it's important to understand that it is made up of `Node` objects connected through references. Unlike arrays, LinkedLists don't use indexing. The first node is called the **head**, and the last node is referred to as the **tail**. Each `Node` contains two things:
- The **data**
- A **reference** (or pointer) to the next node (and to the previous node in doubly or circular versions)

### üß± Structure of Custom Implementation

- In a **Singly Linked List**, each node has `data` and a `next` reference.
- In the `MyLinkedList` class, I defined:
    - A `Node` class with `data` and `next`
    - A `MyLinkedList` class with:
        - `head` (points to the first node)
        - `tail` (points to the last node)
        - `size` (tracks the number of nodes)
        
- In a **Doubly Linked List**, each node maintains references to both the next and previous nodes. This allows traversal in both directions.
- The `MyDoubleLinkedList` class includes:
  - A `Node` class with `data`, `next`, and `previous`
  - A class-level `head` and `tail` to track both ends
  - Methods like `insertFirst()` and `insertLast()` handle insertions at both ends
  - `showList()` prints from head to tail, while `showListReverse()` prints from tail to head

- In a **Circular Linked List**, the last node (tail) links back to the first node (head), forming a loop.
- The `MyCircularLinkedList` class includes:
  - A `Node` class with `data` and `next`
  - A `head` and `tail` pointer to maintain endpoints
  - `insert()` method appends a new node and rewires `tail.next` to `head`
  - `deleteByValue()` searches for a node with a specific value and removes it while maintaining the circular structure
  - `showList()` uses a `do-while` loop to display all nodes starting from `head`

## üèóÔ∏è Constructors

```java
// Creates an empty LinkedList
LinkedList l1 = new LinkedList();

// Creates a LinkedList initialized with elements from a Collection
LinkedList l2 = new LinkedList(Collection c);
```

- `LinkedList()` ‚Äî Initializes an empty linked list.
- `LinkedList(Collection c)` ‚Äî Constructs a linked list containing the elements of the specified collection, in the order they are returned by the collection‚Äôs iterator.

## üîÑ Use Cases

### ‚úÖ LinkedList can be used to implement:

- **Stack**
    - Use `addFirst()` and `removeFirst()` for push/pop
- **Queue**
    - Use `addLast()` and `removeFirst()` for enqueue/dequeue

> Note: `ArrayDeque` is often preferred for performance over `LinkedList` for Stack/Queue due to better cache performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Notes for DSA:

### 1. **Traversal**:
- LinkedList does not allow direct access to elements via an index. You need to traverse from the head or tail node to access an element, which takes O(n) time.

### 2. **Memory Usage**:
- In comparison to arrays, `LinkedList` uses more memory because of the storage required for the next and previous references (pointers) in each node.

### 3. **Applications**:
- **LRU Cache Implementation**: A LinkedList can be used to implement an efficient Least Recently Used (LRU) cache, where elements are moved to the front or back as they are used.
- **Polynomial Representation**: A linked list can be used to represent a polynomial where each node stores a term of the polynomial.
- **Undo Mechanism in Software**: LinkedList can be utilized to keep track of previous actions for undo functionality.

### 4. **Memory Considerations**:
- If memory efficiency is critical and you don‚Äôt need the benefits of dynamic size allocation, using arrays might be a better choice.

### 5. **Doubly Linked List**:
- In a doubly linked list, each node has two references (next and previous), which allows traversal in both directions. This comes at the cost of extra memory overhead compared to singly linked lists.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example Code for LinkedList Operations:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class LinkedListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>();

        // Adding elements
        list.add(10); // Adds at the end
        list.addFirst(5); // Adds at the beginning
        list.addLast(15); // Adds at the end

        // Removing elements
        list.removeFirst(); // Removes the first element
        list.removeLast(); // Removes the last element

        // Accessing elements
        System.out.println("First Element: " + list.getFirst());
        System.out.println("Last Element: " + list.getLast());

        // Traversing the list
        for (Integer num : list) {
            System.out.println(num);
        }
    }
}
```

## üìñ Conclusion

LinkedList is a flexible data structure used for cases where frequent insertions and deletions are necessary. While it doesn't support fast random access, its ability to efficiently add and remove nodes makes it a powerful tool for many applications. Understanding the trade-offs in terms of memory usage and traversal time is important when deciding when to use LinkedList versus other data structures like ArrayList.
